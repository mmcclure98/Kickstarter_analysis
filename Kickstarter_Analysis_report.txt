# Crowdfunding Kickstarter Challenge## Project OverviewThis project was created to help make realistic fundraising goals for a play. We used crowdfunding data to analyze previous entertainment fundraising campaigns. The data contained information such as campaign launch and end dates, location, fundraising goals, and fundraising outcomes.   ### PurposeThe playwriter for this project predicted they would need upwards of $10,000 to fund the production. We used crowdfunding data to gather more information on what makes campaigns such as this one successful. Data that was collected included various information from the beginning to the end of successful and failed campaigns. We used this information to determine what would most likely lead to a successful campaign.    ## Analysis and ChallengesWhile analyzing the data we can determine that the launch date of the campaign and the funding goals will have a significant effect on the success rate. ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch DateBased on the outcomes of theater launch dates we can determine that a campaign beginning in the month of May would have a higher success rate. We can also come to the conclusion that campaigns beginning in March and September will more likely have a lower success rate, and campaigns beginning in October will more likely have a higher rate of failure. ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on GoalsThe outcomes based on goals shows us that campaigns with bigger goals ended up having a higher failure rate. Other than one campaign with a goal between $45,000 to $49,999, campaigns with goals of $20,000-$34,999 had more significant failure percentage rates. ### Challenges and Difficulties EncounteredA challenge that was encountered was finding data for canceled plays. There were many data points for canceled film and video, technology, and music. This made it difficult to predict the outcomes of plays that may have been canceled due to funding. Another challenge was finding more data for successful campaigns with goals between $35,000 and $44,999. The data with the most successful campaigns had goals of less than $1000 to $4,999, but this is below the estimated needed amount for the current project. ## ResultsThe conclusion that I came to from analyzing this data is that it would be best to set a goal under $20,000. The playwriter estimates they would need upwards of $10,000 to fund the production. The campaign would have a higher success rate if the goal is set under $20,000. I also came to the conclusion that May would be the best month to launch the campaign.
